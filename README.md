- Disable the Update button if the form fields has not changed. (isDirty does not detect file change, need to set shouldDirty:true when image field is updated)

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Challenges Faced

- ...
- Pagination
- Routing and route protection
- hover show information (solution: resort to react-tooltip)
- dropdown UI in chat section ()
- react-hook-form validation with customized file-type input (solution: see CategoryDialog.tsx)
- display error separately for each image in multiple file input (solution: show file names in the error message)
- authentication security, store in cookie or localStorage
- in the forms, image can be either string (read from server) or File ()

## üìã Coming Next

- [ ] Use https://react-hook-form.com/get-started for form validation
- [ ] when logput, removes the token from local storage and resets the cache of the Apollo client because some queries might have fetched data to cache, which only logged-in users should have access to. reset the cache using the resetStore method of an Apollo client object
- [ ] what to do with login/signup pages when user already logged in? probbaly remove the access to them until user logs out. And also, during logged in state, the signup/login routes should redirect you to log out page.

- [ ] how to handle manually put-in routes that are not serviced by our site?
- [ ] jsonwebtoken for server side (jwt-decode for client side)
- [ ] compare apexcharts with Chart.js, D3.js
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) error with sign up page

- [ ] Need a settings page for users/sellers to edit their profile
- [ ] login/register page should provide a goback button
- [ ] Do I need to use React Query ?
- [ ] Think about what the seller can see when they are deactivated
- [ ] How to elegantly handle the interface when accessToken expired?
- [ ] consider using auth0 for authentication
- [ ] Do i need a "refresh token" to enhance security? see https://www.cyberchief.ai/2023/05/secure-jwt-token-storage.html
- [ ] Don't show sign in/ sign up options (in UI) when user is already logged in. If user goes to the login/signup page by manually typing in the URL, redirect them to the dashboard.
